# Adaptive design

## Implementing an adaptive layout for all page elements

- The layout is made with three breakpoints: 320px, 768px and 1158px.
- All background and content raster images are responsive and support x1 and x2 density screens.
- The min-resolution media function is used for responsive background images.
- A Mobile First approach is used.
